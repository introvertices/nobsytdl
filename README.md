## No BS Youtube Downloader (with GUI)

### Remember when you could download your favourite meme without getting 3 varieties of herpes and a raging case of tapeworms? Just cos the M.O of Web3 is to ensure it burns every time you take a piss doesn't mean we have to contribute!


NoBSYTDL is a simple frontend for yt-dlp built in Tkinter that allows you to download a video from Youtube, as video or audio (FFmpeg required for MP3). Of course, you should only use this to 'download files you have rights to', but being a well behaved developer is *my* problem, being a well behaved user is *yours*.

No ads, games that promise to make you soil your grubby pants, bitcoin wallets, or BS. Just a download button.

## Requirements:
### Pip install yt-dlp
### FFMpeg if you want mp3 else you'll get m4a/webm audio
